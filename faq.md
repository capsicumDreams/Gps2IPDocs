# FAQ

## Can I use GPS2IP for Apple Maps or Google Maps?

No. Both of these apps _only_ listen to the _onboard_ GPS.  
If your iOS device doesn't have a GPS, you _cannot_ use either of these apps. Period.  
We're sorry that GPS2IP \(or any other app\) can't help you.

## Will it work with app _X_?

Maybe, yes. Please check the main website, and see if your app is listed there.  
If your app is a maritime or aviation app, then it is quite likely.  
If you are a computer hobbyist, then I'm sure you can make it work! 

If it isn't, please get in touch _before buying_ GPS2IP, and we'll try and help figure out if you can!  
We're happy to help, and would prefer that you didn't buy something that you couldn't use.

## What's NMEA? Why do I need it?

If you don't know what NMEA is - then you probably don't need GPS2IP.  
It is a rather specific means of transmitting location and movement data, and lies in a rather niche area.

If you want general lat/long data, with speed and heading information without having to decode NMEA, perhaps you would prefer another app [6signals](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/6signals-track-your-device-and-view-on-the-web/id918928539?mt=8).
