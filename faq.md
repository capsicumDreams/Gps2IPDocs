# FAQ

## Can I use GPS2IP for Apple Maps or Google Maps?

No. Both of these apps _only_ listen to the _onboard_ GPS.  
If your iOS device doesn't have a GPS, you _cannot_ use either of these apps. Period.  
We're sorry that GPS2IP \(or any other app\) can't help you.

## Will it work with app _X_?

Possibly, yes. Please check the main website, and see if your app is listed there.

If it isn't, please get in touch _before buying_ GPS2IP, and we'll try and help figure out if you can!  
We're happy to help, and would prefer that you didn't buy something that you couldn't use.
